### The problems we solve
* Motivates students to participate and complete courses.
* Suggests tutors a sustainable incentive model to participate.
* Become a network for knowledge sharing
* Also give some nudges for the students with PUSH protocol (Channel: eduforall-staging-channel)

### Challenges we ran into
* Incentive Structure: Tokenomics and the incentive structure are main features of our project. We have elaborated on it with several researchs and use cases.
* Superfluid: We had struggled to delploy IBTx token contract on truffle environment with SDK, however, we did it!
* Truffle: Not like in the official documents, typechain truffle-v5 returns uint256 as string not BigNumber when the return type of contract function is struct. However, we got over it!
